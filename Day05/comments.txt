A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does 
not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either 
explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific 
part of code while testing.


Single-Line Comments:
To write a comment just add a ‘#’ at the start of the line.

Multi-Line Comments:
To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line or you can use the multiline string.
Example 1: The use of ‘#’.

#It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
#If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code.
p = 7
if (p > 5):
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")

Output:
p is greater than 5.

Example 2: The use of multiline string.
"""This is an if-else statement.
It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code."""
p = 7
if (p > 5):
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")

Output
p is greater than 5.
